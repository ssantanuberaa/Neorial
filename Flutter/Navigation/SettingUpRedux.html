<h1>Redux</h1>
<p>Redux is an architecture with a unidirectional data flow that makes it easy to develop applications that are easy to test and maintain.</p>
<img src="../Assets/redux-architecture-overview.png">
<p>In Redux there's a <code>Store</code> which holds a <code>State</code> object that represents the state of the whole application. Every application event (either from the user or external) is represented as an <code>Action</code> that gets dispatched to a <code>Reducer</code> function. This <code>Reducer</code> updates the <code>Store</code> with a new <code>State</code> depending on what <code>Action</code> it receives.</p>
<p>And whenever a new <code>State</code> is pushed through the <code>Store</code> the <code>View</code> is recreated to reflect the changes.</p>
<p>With Redux most components are decoupled, making UI changes very easy to make. In addition, the only business logic sits in the <code>Reducer</code> functions. A <code>Reducer</code> is a function that takes an <code>Action</code> and the current application <code>State</code> and it returns a new <code>State</code> object.</p>






<h1>Redux Middleware</h1>
<p>The above at first glance appears to be straightforward, but what happens when the application has to perform some asynchronous operation, such as loading data from an external API? This is why people came up with a new component known as the <code>Middleware</code>.</p>
<p><code>Middleware</code> is a component that may process an <code>Action</code> before it reaches the <code>Reducer</code>. It receives the current application <code>State</code> and the <code>Action</code> that got dispatched, and it can run some code (usually a side effect), such as communicating with a 3rd-party API or data source. Finally, the Middleware may decide to dispatch the original <code>Action</code>, to dispatch a different one, or to do nothing more.</p>
<p>With the <code>Middleware</code>, the above diagram would look like this:</p>

<h1>Redux in Flutter</h1>
<p>Taking all this to Flutter, there's two very useful packages we can use, making it really easy and convenient to implement Redux in a Flutter app:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>redux</code> : The <code>redux</code> package adds all the necessary components to use Redux in Dart, that is, the <code>Store</code>, the <code>Reducer</code> and the <code>Middleware</code>.</li>
	<li><code>flutter_redux</code> : This is a Flutter-specific package which provides additional components on top of the <code>redux</code> library which are useful for implementing Redux in Flutter, such as: <code>StoreProvider</code> (the base Widget for the app that will be used to provide the <code>Store</code> to all the Widgets that need it), <code>StoreBuilder</code> (a Widget that receives the <code>Store</code> from the <code>StoreProvider</code>) and <code>StoreConnector</code> (a very useful Widget that can be used instead of the <code>StoreBuilder</code> as you can convert the <code>Store</code> into a <code>ViewModel</code> to build the Widget tree and whenever the <code>State</code> in the <code>Store</code> is modified, the <code>StoreConnector</code> will get rebuilt).
</li>
</ul>



<h1>StoreConnector</h1>
<p>The widget <code>StoreConnector</code> is used to build UI based on redux state. The StoreConnector requires two different things, converter and builder. It is convertorâ€™s job to convert the data into appropriate view model that can later be used by the builder function to build the user interface.</p>
