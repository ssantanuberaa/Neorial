<h1>Install MySQL</h1>
<p>Open the terminal and run</p>
<pre>
sudo apt install mysql-server
</pre>
<p>It will install MySQL server on your machine. Now before you start using it, you need to configure few things. Type</p>
<pre>
sudo mysql_secure_installation
</pre>
<p>It will walk you through some step to configure your server. Like setting password for the root user, removing test database etc.</p>







<h1>Connecting to server</h1>
<p>To connect to the server and run mysql command:</p>
<pre>
sudo mysql
</pre>
<p>Now you can run any mysql script or statement.</p>
<p>It will login you as root user. Note that as you are using terminal you won't be asked to password for root user to get into the server. But if you do that from any external program, you will be asked to provide the password.</p>
<p>If you want to login to your MySQL server as root from an external program such as <code>phpMyAdmin</code> you can follow below option.</p>
<p>Change the authentication method from <code>auth_socket</code> to <code>mysql_native_password</code>. You can do that by running the following command:</p>
<pre>
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'very_strong_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</pre>
